# MoGen — procedural 3D model generator

Website: <https://krazyjakee.github.io/MoGen/>

`mogen` turns a compact, declarative DSL into `.glb` assets. It is designed to be the
deterministic backend of an LLM-driven 3D generation pipeline: the language model writes
high-level structured scenes, `mogen` expands them into real geometry.

Written in Rust. No runtime, no graph editor, no dependencies on a game engine — just a
small parser, a scene graph, a mesh library, and a glTF exporter.

## Why

LLMs are good at structure and intent, bad at floating-point geometry. A DSL like this
one lets the model decide *what* to build — the parts, their roles, how they relate —
while deterministic Rust code handles *how* to build it. Small outputs, cheap iteration,
no hallucinated triangles.

## Status

Usable but still moving fast. Primitives, CSG, hierarchy/modules, arrays and mirrors,
connectors, skeletons + skinning + animation templates, full PBR materials with embedded
textures, validation diagnostics, and Gemini-driven generate/modify/animate are all
working. See [`docs/dsl.md`](docs/dsl.md) for the full feature surface.

## Install

### Prebuilt binaries (recommended)

Linux and macOS — one-liner installer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krazyjakee/MoGen/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This pulls the latest release from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/krazyjakee/MoGen/releases), verifies the SHA-256
checksum, and installs `mogen` and `mogen-studio` into `$HOME/.local/bin`. Run with
`-s -- --help` for options (`--version`, `--bin-dir`, `--cli-only`, `--studio-only`,
`--force`).

Windows — grab the `mogen-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` archive from the
releases page and extract it somewhere on your `PATH`.

### Build from source

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/krazyjakee/MoGen.git
cd MoGen
./scripts/build-release.sh # cargo build --release --workspace
```

The release binary is at `target/release/mogen`. The `./scripts/run-mogen.sh` wrapper runs it via
`cargo run --release` if you'd rather not add it to `$PATH`.

## Quick start

```sh
./scripts/run-mogen.sh build examples/chair.mog --out chair.glb
```

Drop `chair.glb` into Godot, Blender, three.js, or anything else that reads glTF 2.0.

## Web preview

The browser preview (`crates/mogen-wasm` + `web/`) runs the same parse → lower
→ export pipeline the desktop CLI uses, and renders the resulting GLB with
three.js. CSG (`union`/`difference`/`intersect`) and sibling-mesh merge work
on the wasm build via [`manifold-csg`'s `unstable-wasm-uu` feature][m-csg-wasm],
which cross-compiles the same Manifold C++ kernel used on desktop through
[`wasm-cxx-shim`][shim].

Building the wasm crate needs LLVM 20+ on the host:

- macOS: `brew install llvm` (then prepend `$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin` to PATH)
- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install clang-20 lld-20 libc++-20-dev libc++abi-20-dev`
  (often via [apt.llvm.org][apt-llvm] on older distros)
- Other prefixes: set `WASM_CXX_SHIM_LLVM_BIN_DIR=/path/to/llvm/bin`

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-pack    # if you don't have it yet
wasm-pack build crates/mogen-wasm --target web \
  --out-dir ../../web/wasm --out-name mogen_wasm --release
(cd web && npm install && npm run dev)
```

The first wasm-pack invocation clones Manifold + Clipper2 + wasm-cxx-shim
and runs three cmake cross-compiles; subsequent builds use the cached
artifacts. `./site/build.sh` automates the full playground bundle (wasm-pack
+ Vite) for the gh-pages deploy.

Currently disabled in the browser: texture packing (no fs / no oxipng cross-
compile), the LLM `generate`/`modify`/`animate` flows (server-only), and
top-level `use "file.mog"` imports (no fs). The `unstable-wasm-uu` build is
compiled `-fno-exceptions`, so an STL throw (e.g. `bad_alloc` on extreme
inputs) becomes an unrecoverable wasm trap — the preview tab can recover by
reloading.

## MoGen Studio

A minimal desktop GUI ships alongside the CLI — **MoGen Studio** combines the DSL
editor, a live 3D preview, diagnostics, and one-click Gemini generate/modify/animate
calls. Build and run it with:

```sh
./scripts/run-studio.sh
```

The inspector panel shows a texture roster for the current scene with a ✓/✗ marker
per texture path, so missing image files are visible before you hit "Build GLB".

## The DSL

Files use the `.mog` extension. Every statement has the same shape — a `kind`, an
optional name, attributes, and optional children:

```
kind "optional name" (attr=value, attr=value, ...) {
  // optional children
}
```

A minimal scene:

```mogen
scene {
  box "seat" (pos=[0, 0.5, 0], size=[1.0, 0.1, 1.0])
  box "back" (pos=[0, 1.0, -0.45], size=[1.0, 1.0, 0.1])
}
```

Coordinate system is glTF-standard: right-handed, +Y up, -Z forward. The full grammar,
every node kind, and worked examples live in [`docs/dsl.md`](docs/dsl.md) and
[`examples/`](examples/).

## CLI

```
mogen build    <file.mog> --out <file.glb>         # compile DSL to GLB
mogen generate "a wooden stool" --out out.glb      # generate DSL via Gemini, then compile
mogen modify   <file.mog> "make the legs taller"   # LLM edit of an existing .mog, then recompile
mogen animate  <file.mog> "spin the rotor at 120 rpm"  # LLM edit limited to animations
mogen check    <file.mog>                          # validate a DSL file
mogen inspect  <file.glb>                          # summarize a GLB
```

`generate`, `modify`, and `animate` need `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the environment (or
`--api-key`). `animate` is scoped to top-level animation declarations only (`joint`,
`clip`/`track`, and the `spin` / `open_close` / `wave` / `flap` / `idle` templates) —
it leaves geometry, materials, and hierarchy untouched. There are a few more
developer-facing subcommands (`parse`, `dump-scene`, `bench`) — run `mogen --help`
for the full list.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Good first targets:

- more primitives or parameterized modules in `mogen-geom`
- validation passes in `mogen-dsl/src/lower.rs` (unknown attrs, out-of-range values)
- a second exporter alongside GLB
- snapshot/round-trip tests for the example scenes

Run the test suite with `./scripts/run-tests.sh`.
