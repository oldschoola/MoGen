const t=`// Sports bag: zip across the top, round side pockets, front panel pocket,
// and a transparent brand decal stuck onto the curved front face.
//
// Two flavours of \`conform\` are demonstrated:
//   * Path mode — strip stretched between two connectors (the zipper).
//   * Patch mode — flat / disc child laid down at a single anchor and bent
//     to follow surface curvature (the pockets).
//
// For the brand decal, the \`decal\` node's own \`on=\`/\`at=\` shortcut
// synthesizes the patch-mode conform automatically — no separate \`conform\`
// node needed. That's the preferred way to stick a transparent image onto a
// curved surface; you only fall back to authoring \`decal\` + \`conform\`
// explicitly when you need attrs the shortcut doesn't expose.
